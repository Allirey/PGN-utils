## TODO:

* option to keep NAG tags (marks for moves such as "!" or "!?")
* option to merge games from multiple files (not sure about this, read __Note__ below)

##### Note:
Keep in mind: it is NOT that program which merge multiple pgn __files__ in one, merges affects only on  __games__. For such feature you can write your own program, just type in command line:

for windows: \
`
type *.pgn > result.pgn
`

for linux: \
`
cat *.pgn > result.pgn
`
###### congratulations! now you are programmer...
